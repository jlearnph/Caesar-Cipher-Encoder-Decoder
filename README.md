# Caesar-Cipher-Encoder-Decoder

This is a caesar cipher message encoder / decoder

Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced 
by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

For example.

A left shift of 3 means:
D -> A
E -> B
3 -> 0

A right shift of 5 means:
G -> L
Z -> E
9 -> 4
